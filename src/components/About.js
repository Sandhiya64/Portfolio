      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a highly driven IT professional with a background in biotechnology engineering and a sharp focus
        on technology. By 25, I aim to be a CEO of a product-based company. I'm currently building
        scalable web applications and AI-powered systems that solve real-world problems. With a deep
        curiosity and an obsession with value creation, I specialize in shipping practical, user-focused
        solutions - fast.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently working full-time at Zifo, I pursue freelance gigs to expand my problem-solving exposure
        and accelerate my path to building products that matter.
